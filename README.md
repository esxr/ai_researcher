# Extended STORM

> _[STORM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14207), developed by Shao et al., is a research assistant designed for generating comprehensive Wikipedia-style articles._

In this notebook, I try to extend [the original notebook](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/storm/storm/#construct-the-interview-graph) further in the following manner:
- Using better prompt frameworks to device prompts.
- Adding more (and better) sources than Wikipedia
- _(I'll keep updating this list as I work more on this...)_
